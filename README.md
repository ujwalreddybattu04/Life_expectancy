# Life_expectancy
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various indicators that affect life expectancy. Some of the key features include:
- **GDP per Capita**
- **Adult Mortality Rate**
- **Infant Deaths**
- **Alcohol Consumption**
- **Health Expenditure**
- **HIV/AIDS Prevalence**
- **Education Levels**
- **Body Mass Index (BMI)**
- **Smoking Rates**

The target variable is **Life Expectancy**.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - Import the dataset and inspect for missing values.
   - Handle missing or inconsistent data.
   - Encode categorical variables and normalize/scale numerical features as needed.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize the distribution of features.
   - Identify correlations between features and the target variable.
   - Detect and manage outliers.

3. **Model Building**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict life expectancy.
   - Tune hyperparameters to optimize performance.

4. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluate models using metrics such as **Accuracy (â‰ˆ80%)**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.
   - Use cross-validation to ensure model stability.

5. **Interpretation and Insights**
   - Analyze feature importance to understand which variables most affect life expectancy.
   - Present findings that could be useful for policy and decision-making.

## Technologies and Libraries
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For model building, training, and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **XGBoost** (optional): For advanced gradient boosting models.
